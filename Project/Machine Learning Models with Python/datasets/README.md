## Datasets

This folder contains small sample datasets used for demonstration and educational purposes
in machine learning experiments.

Most datasets used in this project are either:
- Publicly available datasets
- Built-in datasets provided by scikit-learn
- Loaded directly from online sources

Large datasets and original raw data are intentionally not included in this repository
to keep the project lightweight and focused on model implementation.

### Notes
- This folder may contain only small or sample datasets.
- For real-world datasets, links or loading functions are provided directly in the code.
