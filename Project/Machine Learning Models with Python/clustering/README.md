## Clustering Models

This folder contains clustering examples implemented in Python using scikit-learn.
The focus is on unsupervised learning, cluster formation, and data visualization.

### Files

- `kmeans.py`  
  Demonstrates K-Means clustering using synthetic data generated with make_blobs.  
  Covers model training, cluster assignment, and visualization of clustered data points
  along with cluster centroids.

### Techniques and Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (KMeans, make_blobs)

### Key Concepts
- Unsupervised learning
- Distance-based clustering
- Cluster centroids
- Data visualization in clustering

### Key Learnings
- Applying K-Means clustering to unlabeled data
- Interpreting clustering results and cluster structure
- Visualizing clusters and centroids
- Understanding the impact of the number of clusters (k)
