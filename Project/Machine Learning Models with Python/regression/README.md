## Regression Models

This folder contains regression examples implemented in Python using scikit-learn.
The focus is on understanding regression workflows, model training, prediction,
evaluation, and data visualization.

### Files

- `linear_regression.py`  
  Demonstrates a basic linear regression model using synthetic data.  
  Covers data generation, model training, prediction, and visualization of the regression line.

- `temperature_prediction_model.py`  
  Predicts maximum temperature from minimum temperature using a real-world dataset.  
  Includes train-test splitting and evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.

### Techniques and Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (LinearRegression, model evaluation metrics)

### Key Learnings
- Building end-to-end regression workflows
- Preparing data for machine learning models
- Evaluating regression performance using multiple metrics
- Visualizing predictions and model behavior
