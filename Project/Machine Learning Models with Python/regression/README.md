## Regression Models

This folder contains regression examples implemented in Python using scikit-learn.
The focus is on understanding end-to-end regression workflows, including data
preprocessing, model training, prediction, evaluation, and visualization.

### Files

- `linear_regression.py`  
  Demonstrates a basic linear regression model using synthetic data.  
  Covers data generation, model training, prediction, and visualization of the
  regression line.

- `temperature_prediction_model.py`  
  Predicts maximum temperature from minimum temperature using a real-world dataset.  
  Includes train-test splitting and evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE,
  and R² score.

- `model_evaluation.py`  
  Focuses on evaluating regression model performance using multiple metrics.  
  Demonstrates result comparison and error analysis on real-world data.
