## Dimensionality Reduction

This folder contains dimensionality reduction examples implemented in Python using scikit-learn.
The focus is on reducing feature dimensionality, preserving important information,
and visualizing high-dimensional data.

### Files

- `pca_basic.py`  
  Demonstrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on synthetic data.  
  Covers dimensionality reduction, explained variance ratio, and visualization
  of principal components.

- `pca_mnist.py`  
  Applies PCA to the MNIST dataset to reduce dimensionality of image data.  
  Includes feature reduction, inverse transformation, and visualization of
  original versus reconstructed images.

### Techniques and Tools
