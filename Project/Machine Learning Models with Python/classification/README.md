## Classification Models

This folder contains classification examples implemented in Python using scikit-learn.
The focus is on understanding classification workflows, model training, prediction,
model evaluation, and performance analysis.

### Files

- `k_nearest_neighbors.py`  
  Implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using a real-world dataset.  
  Includes train-test splitting, model training, prediction, and evaluation using
  accuracy score and classification report.

- `gaussian_naive_bayes.py`  
  Demonstrates a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier for categorical and numerical data.  
  Covers data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and accuracy evaluation.

- `diabetes_prediction_knn.py`  
  Applies KNN classification to predict diabetes outcomes using a medical dataset.  
  Includes confusion matrix analysis and performance evaluation.
