## Classification Models

This folder contains classification examples implemented in Python using
scikit-learn. The focus is on supervised classification workflows, including
data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

### Files

- `diabetes_prediction_knn.py`  
  Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict diabetes outcomes from medical data.  
  Includes feature selection, train-test splitting, and performance evaluation.

- `income_prediction_gaussian_nb.py`  
  Implements Gaussian Naive Bayes for income classification.  
  Demonstrates categorical feature encoding and probabilistic classification.

- `K-nearest_Neighbors.py`  
  A basic implementation of KNN classification to illustrate distance-based
  learning concepts.

- `gaussian_naive_bayes.py`  
  Demonstrates Naive Bayes classification on structured data.  
  Focuses on probability-based decision making and model accuracy evaluation.

- `face.py`  
  Applies classification techniques to face recognition data.  
  Demonstrates image-based classification, dimensionality reduction, and
  model evaluation using real datasets.
