## Machine Learning Fundamentals

This project demonstrates fundamental machine learning algorithms implemented
using Python and scikit-learn.

The focus is on understanding model workflows, evaluation metrics, and data
visualization rather than hyperparameter tuning.

## Topics Covered

- Linear Regression (synthetic and real-world datasets)
- Classification (KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes)
- Clustering (K-Means)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, PCA on MNIST)
- Neural Networks (MLP on MNIST)
- Model Evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², Accuracy)
- Data Visualization (integrated with models)

## Key Learnings

- Understanding end-to-end machine learning workflows
- Applying appropriate evaluation metrics for different models
- Visualizing data and model predictions
- Working with both synthetic and real-world datasets
